# House-Price-Prediction

This project involves predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features like location, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on these features. Although the current model is not highly effective, there is scope for improvement through more advanced techniques and feature engineering.

Project Overview
The dataset used in this project is the House Price Prediction Dataset, which contains information about houses and their prices. The project focuses on applying Linear Regression to predict house prices, after preprocessing the data and visualizing key trends.

Key Steps in the Project:
  Data Preprocessing:
    Handle missing values.
    Encode categorical features using One-Hot Encoding.
    Standardize numerical features for better model performance.
    
  Modeling:
    Use Linear Regression to train the model.
    Evaluate the model using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure prediction accuracy.
    
  Data Visualization:
    Plot histograms and boxplots to analyze the distribution of house prices and their relationships with different features.
    
Tools & Technologies
  Python
  Pandas for data manipulation
  Matplotlib for data visualization
  Scikit-learn for machine learning
  Numpy for numerical operations

How to Use
  Load the dataset: The dataset is loaded using pandas.read_csv(), and missing values are handled during the preprocessing phase.

  Preprocess the data:
    One-hot encode categorical features (Location, Condition).
    Standardize numerical columns (Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, etc.).
    Train the model: Use Linear Regression to fit the model to the dataset.

  Evaluate the model: Use Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess how well the model is performing.

  Visualize the results: Create histograms and boxplots to analyze the distribution of prices across different features.

Model Improvement
  Currently, the model is not highly effective, and the accuracy can be improved. Future steps include:
  Experimenting with other algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting).
  Feature engineering and adding more meaningful features to the dataset.
  Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
